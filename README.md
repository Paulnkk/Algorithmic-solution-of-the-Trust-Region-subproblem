# Algorithmic-solution-of-the-Trust-Region-subproblem
I formulated a paper on approximate solution (local optimization) of trust-region auxiliary problems as part of my studies in Karlsruhe. 

First, the necessary theory (CG-method and Krylov subspaces) for the formulation of the Steihaug-Toint and Generalized Lanczos Trust-Region method is introduced. Subsequently, both methods are introduced with intuitive geometric considerations. At last, I implemented both methods in Python and examined them for runtime, accuracy of approximation and other performance metrics

I thank my former supervisor Robert Mohr, Ph.D in supporting this work.
